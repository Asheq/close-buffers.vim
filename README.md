# close-buffers.vim

This plug-in allows you to quickly `bdelete` several buffers at a time. It is useful if you want to
prune your buffer list or free up memory.

It provides a single new command called `Bdelete` that takes a single parameter describing which
buffers to `bdelete`. See the list of possible parameters [below](#commands).

## Recommended key mapping

I recommend one of the following key mappings:

```
nnoremap <silent> <C-q> :Bdelete menu<CR>
```
```
nnoremap <silent> Q     :Bdelete menu<CR>
```

## Install
You can use any plugin manager you want. Some popular options:

- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug): `Plug 'Asheq/close-buffers.vim'`
- [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim): `Plugin 'Asheq/close-buffers.vim'`
- [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen): `cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone git://github.com/asheq/close-buffers.git`
- Manual: Copy the files into your `.vim` directory.

## Other Info

### Buffers with unsaved changes
By default, `Bdelete` will fail to `bdelete` modified buffers, i.e., buffers that have unsaved
changes.

In order to force `Bdelete` to `bdelete` modified buffers, add a bang to the end of the command,
i.e., `Bdelete!`.

Alternatively, you can configure Vim to ask you to interactively confirm each modified buffer being
`bdeleted`. This can be done by setting the native Vim `confirm` option with `:set confirm`.

### Bwipeout
If you know what you are doing, you can use `Bwipeout` instead of `Bdelete` to `bwipeout` buffers
instead of `bdelete` them. `Bwipeout` has the same [parameters](#commands) as `Bdelete`.

### Inspiration
This plugin was inspired by [vim-bufonly](https://github.com/schickling/vim-bufonly), but adds
several related actions.

### License
Same license as Vim itself.

### Todo
- Add option to not mess up window layout
